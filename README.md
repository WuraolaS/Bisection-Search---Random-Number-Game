# Bisection-Search---Random-Number-Game
I am thinking of a number from one to 10, try to guess. Just insert a number and the game will tell you if you are too low or too high


I would like you to also do the following:

1. Merge my addition/branch to the README into your 'master'.  
2. Create a game where I can input the range of guesses ie 1 to X.  There should be a prompt allowing me to do this.
3. Count the amount of loops it takes to guess. 
4. Print that count as part of the UX.
